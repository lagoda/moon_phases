This is a pile of lists of times of moon phases. 

I was shocked to learn that this is something that one could possibly need, but it was and I did. 

The actual data comes courtesy of Fred Espenak and his page at www.Astropixels.com

He seems serious and cool, but his website is formatted more for humans to read than machines, and I needed full moon data for a program, so I found myself massaging the format, and I figure it might be worth putting that where other people can use it.

I don't need or want any credit, and I don't guarantee that I didn't accidentally break anything in translation. Use at your own risk, etc.
